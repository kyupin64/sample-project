        <div id="about-section">
            <p>I graduated from High School in 2021, and that fall started at UVU majoring in computer science. Up to that point, I had 
            been living off my savings from working at Texas Roadhouse in my sophomore year of high school, but my savings eventually 
            ran dry and I had to get a new job to help pay for college, rent, etc. I began working as a delivery driver at Jimmy John's, 
            and I actually quite liked my job at first, as I could just drive around and listen to music half the time. I also really 
            liked my coworkers, they always made it fun when I was inshop. Anyway, I did very well in college at first, but having a 
            job while going to school full time became very stressful for me, and I dropped out of college after just one and a half 
            semesters. For most of 2022 and 2023, I worked full time at Jimmy John's with no real goals or direction in life. Though 
            I had liked my job at first, it became dreadful for me, day in and day out doing the same exact thing. The new management 
            team didn't help my growing dislike of the job. So I began to reflect and really think about what I wanted to do with my 
            life. I researched different careers I could pursue, different schools and programs I could invest in, and eventually I 
            realized the answer had been right in front of me the whole time, literally. MTECH is just down the road from my house, 
            and I had been taking deliveries to the cosmetology building for the past two years! So I decided to become a student here 
            and take the intro course, and over the past few months, I've discovered that coding is actually quite fun for me! I had 
            been studying computer science at UVU, but I had to do so many general education classes that I wasn't really focusing on 
            programming, and it quickly became overwhelming for me. I questioned if it was even the right career path for me, and I 
            nearly gave up. But I'm glad I didn't, because now I'm here :)</p>
